This package features a Model View Controller architecture to implement a simple menu UI component.  This component is handled by the `MobileMenuApplicationController` object which takes in two arguments: a `MobileMenuButtonController` and a `MobileMenuController`.  These objects demonstrate dependency injection by moving dependencies from an internal, to an injection.

To install the application, run `npm install @npm-csrail/mobile-menu`.  Then import the `MobileMenuApplicationController` and the necessary objects to complete the dependency injection.
